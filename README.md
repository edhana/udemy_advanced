# Learn Advanced C++ Programming
This is a course from Udemy. I am posting here some tests I've been doing with each study session of the course. This is a personal project for later reference.

I am using googletest to test and execute the exercises. That is just to help me remember the test functions and methods of the googletest api.

## Docker

Yes, I had to use a docker image (the official gcc) to build this app using the latests gcc version compatible with C++17. Just to test some new features of gcc.

## Running the code
As I am using docker to build and run the project run `docker build --rm .`

## Exercises
Each session is focused to a "advanced" topic.

### Session 2 - Exceptions

### Session 3 - Files
